# work-portfolio

## Description

This project is a work portfolio page created from scratch with no starter code or documents. The purpose of this application is to showcase my skills and talents with the work I have completed so far.
In addition, I will be able to switch out placeholder items for future projects/ documents as things progress. My contact information is also provided as a wsy for colleagues and future employers to get a hold of me. 


## Tasks Completed

- Included my name and recent photo.
- Created links corresponding to the different titled sections in my portfolio ("About Me", "Work", "Contact Me")
- Created a link which opens a placeholder "resume" document
- Created images corresponding to each work project and made the first application the largest
- Created links to contact information
- Linked each project to their deployed websites, with the exception of placeholder items for future projects
- Created a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports
